# MonoStack-SpeakerView

**Project Description:**

This C++ project, "Do You See What I See?" is designed to process data and identify individuals who can see the front based on their height. It utilizes a custom stack data structure called MonoStack for efficient data processing and analysis. The program reads data from an input file, computes the heights of individuals who can see in each column, and displays the results on the console.

**Project Structure:**

- `main.cpp`: The main program file that reads the input file and initiates the data processing.
- `MonoStack.h`: A modified custom stack data structure for maintaining elements in either ascending or descending order.
- `SpeakerView.h` and `SpeakerView.cpp`: A class for handling the input file, data processing, and generating the output.
- `OriginalMonoStack.h`: The original monocronic increasing and decreasing stack data structure.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
